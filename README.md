# This is a project where I play around with node.js, next.js, React and tailwind

# To run projecct
## npm i in both backend, frontend and root project, and then you can do npm run dev in root folder to run both BE and FE simultaneously. 

## Frontend runs on localhost:3000, backend on localhost:5000

## To log in I have 3 test-users. For example sophia@example.com with password "password123"
